# Hydrate
A simple Godot plugin to make you remember to hydrate periodically. Beneficial especially for developers who migrated from fancy engines that have long compile times. Unfortunately Godot does not have long compile times or other features for you to have a coffee break. This plugin will help you stay hydrated.

## Settings
There are some very simple settings to customize the plugin:

- Activate: Activates or deactivates the reminders.
- Interval: Time between reminders in minutes.
- Enable popup: Shows a popup as reminder.
- Enable sound: Plays a short sound as reminder.

If you deactivate both popup and sound, the whole reminder gets deactivated.

### Popup
If you think the popup is annoying, and too lazy to go to Editor Settings, next time it shows up, just check the `Disable popup` checkbox to deactivate the popup.
